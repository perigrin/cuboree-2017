# Kim's Game

Set out the items on the grid in the following order:

 First-aid kit | Flashlight | Whistle
Sun protection | Trail food | Water bottle
     Batteries | Book       | Rock


On "GO" uncover the items for 1 minute. The scouts are not to write down anything during this period but are asked to remember what items there are.

Cover the items and have each scout write down every item he remembers. After three minutes the scout with the most items on his list has been the most observant. Ask them which six things are the Cub Scout Six Essentials (the first two rows above).
