This Game is meant for Boy Scouts, Wolf scouts, Bear scouts, Webelos scouts.
Required:
Large piece of cardboard with 9, 16, or 25 squares depending on skill level of scouts.
Various items to place on the cardboard - red feather, black feather, gray stone, white stone, neckerchief, pocketknife, pinecone, sunscreen, ...
Preparation:
Place all the items on the board, one in each square. Do this away from the group so they do not get to study it. Write down what is where.
Instructions:
Scouts silently gather around the board and observe the items on it and their placement for 30 seconds.
All items are swept off into a pile.
The timer is set as the scouts walk around the board in a circle, each taking his turn to put an item in position.
On his turn, a scout may choose to move an item from one square to another if he feels it is incorrect.
When all items are in place, and the team signals that they are finished, 1 point is awarded for each correct item and the time is recorded.

Allow the team to discuss a plan for 30 seconds away from the game while the items are arranged again. See if a better score can be made in a shorter time.
