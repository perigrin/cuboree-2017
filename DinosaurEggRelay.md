# Dinosaur Egg Relay Race

Divide everyone into even sized teams of at least 3 kids each. Have each team split into two groups and have them stand 30 (adult sized) paces apart. Pick a side of the room and give each team a spoon on that side. Place an Egg onto each spoon.

On GO the scout with the spoon will race to his team mate across the room, hand them the spoon, then the new scout races back. If the egg falls off the spoon they must re-start their leg of the race. The first team to have all of their scouts finish wins.
