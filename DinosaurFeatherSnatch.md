# Dinosaur Feather Snatch

Give every scout a handful of clothespins to pin anywhere on their clothes where they can be reached by other scouts.

Once everyone has pinned their feathers on give give them a count down then GO.  Then everyone tries to pull a clothespin off someone else. As soon as a clothespin is snatched, the scout that stole it kneels down and pins the clothespin to his clothes. While kneeling, a scout is safe from having a clothespin taken.

After 5 minutes, call TIME. Whomever has the most clothespins is declared the winner. Gather back all the clothes pins and start a new round.

You may need to set rules to prevent kneeling too long or kneeling without first snatching a clothespin.
