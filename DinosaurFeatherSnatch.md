# Dinosaur Feather Snatch

Give every scout a handful of clothespins to pin anywhere on their clothes where they can be reached by other scouts.

On 'Go' signal, everyone tries to pull a clothespin off someone else. As soon as a clothespin is snatched, the scout that stole it kneels down. He pins the clothespin to his clothes. While kneeling, a scout is safe from having a clothespin taken.

Set a time limit and see who (or which team) has the most clothespins when time is called.

You may need to set rules to prevent kneeling too long or kneeling without first snatching a clothespin.
