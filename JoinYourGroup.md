# Dinosuars of a Feather

Hand each scout a slip of paper with a stamp marked on it, each with a different dinosaur (Pterodactyl, Triceratops, Raptor). The scouts are not to look at their slips.

On 'GO' signal, scouts mill about the room exchanging slips as many times as they can with as many different scouts as possible. They do not look at what is written on the paper.

On 'STOP' signal, scouts stop and look at their paper.

On 'FIND YOUR FLOCK' signal, scouts try to find all others of their kind and then sit down together. The last group to sit is out, taking their papers with them.
Repeat until only one flock is left.

When finding your flock, you can only imersonate the dinosaur you have, no talking.
