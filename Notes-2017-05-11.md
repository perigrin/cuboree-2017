Richard will reach out to Winter Park Garden Club 2 weeks before the event to make sure that they can provide us with overflow parking.

Council requires us to make a 30% profit margin on costs to cover their expenses.

We expect a budget of roughly $10/paid attendee. Previous years we had roughly 400 paid attendees.

Dates are September 22nd / 23rd. Some packs will have *just* recruited by then so lots of parents may be brand new.

Troop 62 will be approached (by Dennis) to run Shooting Sports.

Troop 24 was suggested to help lash us a gate / park entrace, but Doran Fish has suggested he'll build us one.

Mark will be getting me (Chris) the past years' information. Including schedule, and working budget.

Past years have had around 10 events.

Ideas for events:
    * Shooting Sports (BB's & Archery)
    * Art Event (Sponsored by Super Awesome Cool Pottery in exchange for branding)
    * Egg Race
    * Nature Walk (with dinosaur encounter?)
    * Obstacle Course
    * Bobcat Station

Campfire needs planning. Chris is planning on worrying about that. Richard was going to reach out to concil about getting the Black Shirts involved for AV Support.

Need to make sure there is staff to help with Parking. Especially if no Overflow Parking.
Need to have staff for Registration on Saturday *first thing*.

Need to be sure to have enough Popcorn / be able to produce popcorn fast enough for Friday Night crackerbarrell.

OA Grill will provide lunch and dinner.

Need Recruting material for May Roundtable. Recruiting both _participants_ and _volunteers_.
